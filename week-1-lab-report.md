1. Installing VScode 

![image1](https://github.com/air-wickvu/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/images/week-1-lab-report-image1.png) 

a. I had Visual Studio installed prior to this course. I updated and confirmed it is a working version on my workstation. <br />
b. If not installed yet, https://code.visualstudio.com/ , and follow the instructions to install 
  
2. Remotely Connecting

a. I went to the link provided in the lab guide and reseted my password. After a successful reset, I was able to ssh onto the server with my account. <br />
b. Link for course-specific account: https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php
  
3. Trying Some Commands

a. In this step, I was testing commands on the server side. I created a new folder and removed the folder. I accessed different directories and created new folders within. I was able to navigate between directories. 
  
4. Moving Files with scp

a. In this step, I created a java file named WhereAmI with sample code. I was able to successfully scp to the server. I was able to confirm the file was copied successfully by ssh into the server and checking if it is there. 

5. Setting an SSH key

![image5.2](https://github.com/air-wickvu/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/images/week-1-lab-report-image5.2.png)
a. Had an issue where the file would not show in the client. Was able to fix by creating folder beforehand <br />
b. Confirmed pub key is the same on both sides
6. Optimizing Remote Running

![image6.2](https://github.com/air-wickvu/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/images/week-1-lab-report-image6.2.png)
a. In this step, I used the terminal command ‘nano’ to edit within the terminal. I then copied the file WhereAmI.java to the server. I went ahead and compiled and ran the java file. Unfortunately, java is not installed on the server so the file was not able to run. In theory, this would have worked.
