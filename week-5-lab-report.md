- The `grep -h` command searches for a pattern of characters (ex: apple) in a file(s) (ex: `./technical/*/*.txt`) then displays the matched lines. This command can be useful when searching for keywords in multiple files. It can also be useful if the programmer can only partially recall a string so grep solve this issue by searching for a pattern of characters. 

2. Command Line Option 1: `grep -h "play" ./technical/government/*/*.txt` <br/>

- The `grep -h` command searches for a pattern of characters (ex: play) in a file(s) (ex: `./technical/government/*/*.txt`) then displays the matched line. This command can be useful when searching for keywords in multiple files. It can also be useful if the programmer wants to peek at the code surrounding the keyword to get a better understanding. 

3. Command Line Option 1: `grep -h "top" technical/911report/chapter-2.txt`
- Function: Display the matched lines, but does not display the filenames.

- The `grep -h` command searches for a pattern of characters (ex: top) in a file(s) (ex: `technical/911report/chapter-2.txt`) then displays the matched line. This command can be useful when searching for a word in a single file like in this example. Similar to a find shortcut (ctrl+f), I can use grep to find the matched pattern of characters but a benefit of -h is it displays the matched lines. 

4. Command Line Option 2: ` grep -c "apple" technical/911report/*.txt `
- Function: Prints only a count of the lines that match a pattern 
- Output: 
`technical/911report/chapter-1.txt:0

`
- The `grep -c` command searches for a pattern of characters (ex: apple) in a file(s) (ex: `technical/911report/*.txt`) then displays the count of matched pattern for each file. This command can be useful when you would like to know how often a keyword is being used in mulitple files at once. In this example, in the 911report folder, the matched pattern was only found in one text file. 

5. Command Line Option 2: `grep -c "apple" technical/Government/*/c*.txt`
- Function: Prints only a count of the lines that match a pattern 
- Output: 
technical/Government/About_LSC/commission_report.txt:3
technical/Government/About_LSC/conference_highlights.txt:0
technical/Government/Env_Prot_Agen/ctf1-6.txt:0
technical/Government/Env_Prot_Agen/ctf7-10.txt:0
technical/Government/Env_Prot_Agen/ctm4-10.txt:0
`
- The `grep -c` command searches for a pattern of characters (ex: apple) in a file(s) (ex: `technical/Government/*/c*.txt`) then displays the count of matched pattern for each file. In this example, in the Government folder, searching in files that start with 'c', it was found three times in a single text file. This can be useful for a programmer when searching in a directory with many files and needs to quickly know how often the pattern is used in the codebase for specific files. 

6. Command Line Option 2: `grep -c "apple" technical/government/about_lsc/commission_report.txt`
- Function: Prints only a count of the lines that match a pattern 
- Output: 
`3` 
- The `grep -c` command searches for a pattern of characters (ex: apple) in a file(s) (ex: `technical/government/about_lsc/commission_report.txt`) then displays the count of matched pattern for the specific file. In this example, I wanted the count for the matched pattern for a specific file. This can be useful for a programmer when they want to quickly know how many times the matched pattern appears in a single file. 

7. Command Line Option 3: `grep -w "JSTOR" technical/plos/*.txt`
- Function: Match Whole Word 
- Output:

`
- The `grep -w` command searches for a specific pattern of characters (ex: JSTOR) in a file(s) (ex: `technical/government/about_lsc/commission_report.txt`) then displays the matched pattern with the filename and the surrounding content as well. In this example, is useful to quickly inspect where the matched pattern is located as well as the matched line to get a further understanding. 

8. Command Line Option 3: `grep -lw "apple" technical/government/*/*.txt`
- Function: `-l` Displays list of filenames only 
- Function: `-w` Match whole word 
- Output: 
`technical/government/About_LSC/commission_report.txt`
- The `grep` command searches for a pattern of characters (ex: apple) in a file(s) (ex: `technical/government/*/*.txt`) and then `-l` displays the filename of the matched pattern but with the `-w` added, it matches the whole word only. In this example, it can be useful if you need to find a specific keyword and need to quickly know where the matched keywords are located. 

9. Command Line Option 3: `grep -wlv "JSTOR" technical/plos/*.txt`
- Function: `-w` Match whole word 
- Function: `-l` Displays list of filenames only 
- Function: `-v` Prints out all the lines that do not match

`
- The ` -w` command searches for a specific pattern of characters (ex: JSTOR) in a file(s) (ex: `technical/plos/*.txt`). But, with the `-v` the files returned is the files that do not contain the keyword. Additionally with  `-l` it displays the filename of the matched pattern. In this example, it can be useful if you need to omit a specific keyword and need to know which files do not contain the keyword.
